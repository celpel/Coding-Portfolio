This program creates a health bar given a value from the user (usually the GM).
It also allows the user to decrease the health bar given some attack value.
When the "SC" button is clicked, a screenshot of the bar is taken and cropped, then saved to a temporary directory. From there, it is then accessible through QuestBot (another project in the C# folder).
