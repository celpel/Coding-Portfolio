The following program is a bot for the chatroom, Discord, using the Discord.NET API.
It was designed for managing the stats of players in a game run in a separate client.
The bot comes with a set of commands that can be run asynchronously.
Commands are seperated based on the role of the person accessing them (i.e. a Game Master (GM) can access different commands to a Player.)
All player stats or changes to the game are saved to a local SQL Database.
